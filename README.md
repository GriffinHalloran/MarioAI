Since the base of our code is from marioai.org, there are a lot of random files that deal with game physics, enemy representation, etc. Most of them are irrelevent and have nothing to do with out code. For our implementation, the main files are levelSceneSnapshot (what we used to load our worlds) located in src.ch.idsia.astar.assets, AmiCoSimulator (what we use to actually run the file)located in src.ch.idsia.benchmark.mario.simulation, aStarAgent (our main agent for running our program) located in src.HalloranBaker.Astar, and aStarSimulator (where all of our searching is located for our algorithm) in src.HalloranBaker.Astar. To run the program, go to AmiCoSimulator and run the file. This should have Mario run througha level with our algorithm. To change levels, change the number after "-ls". If Mario doesnt run smoothly, then a slightchange is needed to the code (depending on the computer, Mario can search longer giving better results. Sometimesthis messes up how to program runs. If it does, go to aStarSimulator and change the cpu value in the otpimize function to 3 or 1).
